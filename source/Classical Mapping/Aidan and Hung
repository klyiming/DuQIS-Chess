Classical Mappings:
Aidan and Hung

Take Erics possible positions function, and try to convert to a proper form, whilst also keeping a copy of the original form (1D list)

For example    ((0, 1, -1), (0)       , (0, 3)
		(0),      , (3, -3, 1), (0)
		(1, -1),  , (3, 0, -1), (3, 1, -1)) 
		
		So a 2d array, in the shape of the board, of arrays of varying length. 
		
END: Take the 1D list array, and filter out with final results
